- There are two core ways to accept payments on Stripe:

  - Stripe Checkout
  - Payment Intents API
  - Note: There is also a third way called Charges API. While Charges API are not deprecreated, but Stripe plans to focus product development on Payment Intents to make it the foundational Stripe API.

- In this project we will use the Stripe Checkout, the quickest way to build conversion-optimized payment forms, hosted on Stripe.

## Stripe Checkout

- Stripe Checkout is a prebuilt payment page that you can redirect your customer to for simple purchases and subscriptions. It provides many features, such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, internationalization, and form validation.
